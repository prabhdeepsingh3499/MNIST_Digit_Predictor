# MNIST_Digit_Predictor
The goal is to build a Neural Network which is able to predict the numbers using in range of 1-9 using Python.
This is done using the following libraries- Keras ( tensorflow in backend ). Matplotlib ( for plotting and analysing the data ). Numpy ( for mathematical calculations and normalising data ). Warnings (To ignore warnings and make code readable ).

The data has been taken from Keras MNIST dataset. Explanation:

1. Loading the Libraries.

2. Loading the data and spliting it into Train and Test Data.
